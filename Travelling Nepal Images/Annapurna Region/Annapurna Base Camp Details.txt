OverView:
The Annapurna Base Camp Trek (ABC) is one of the most popular trekking experiences in Nepal. It is an amazing walk through a diverse landscape and culture, complete with stunning mountain vistas, terraced fields, quaint Gurung villages, and a wide variety of flora and fauna. Mt. Annapurna (8091m) is the 10th highest mountain in the world, and the hike to its base camp, which sits at an altitude of 4130m/13549ft, is one of the best treks in Nepal. Moreover, we reach our destination via Mt. Machhapuchhre (Fishtail), which is revered by the Nepalese for its unique beauty. Thanks to the well-groomed itinerary of the Annapurna Base Camp trekking package, it is a popular choice among diverse outdoor enthusiasts, from solo female travelers to hikers traveling in groups in Nepal.

Our Annapurna Base Camp Trek itinerary comprises 11 days, which is shorter compared to most treks in this region leading up to the base camp. This particular route is designed for globetrotters who wish to hike to the base camp of the spectacular mountain but are limited by time. For travelers who want to experience more trekking in Nepal in a relaxed manner, they can try a different route like the Annapurna Sanctuary Trek â€“ 14 Days, which would be a better option.
