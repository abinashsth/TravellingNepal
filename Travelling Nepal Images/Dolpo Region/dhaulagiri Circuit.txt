The Dhaulagiri Circuit trek is a long trek that passes through high alpine pastures, uninhabited valleys, high windswept passes, forests and cultivated terraced hills. Crossing two passes – the French Pass at 5,360m and Dhampus Pass at 5,200m, and including the Dhaulagiri Base Camp at 4,740m, this is a challenging trek which requires a high level of fitness. However, with good stamina and basic mountaineering skills, the rewards of this trek include stunning views of Tukuche Peak (6,920m), Dhaulagiri I (8,167m), Dhaulagiri ii (7,751m), Dhaulagiri III (7,715m) and Dhaulagiri V (7,618m).

Dhaulagiri rises above the deepest gorge in the world, the Kali Gandaki, and the circuit route provides stunning views of the whole Dhaulagiri range. Discovered in 1808, standing at 8,167m, Dhaulagiri was thought to be the highest mountain in the world until 30 years later when Kanchenjunga took that honour; later to be taken away by Mount Everest!   The Dhaulagiri Circuit route was discovered in the 1950s by a French team, hence the French Pass, which leads into a lonely area known as Hidden Valley.

The circuit trail makes its way through villages and terraced farm land, along rivers and gorges, and along glaciers and moraine. With time to acclimatize before tackling the high passes there is plenty of opportunity to take in the magnificent mountain vistas.
