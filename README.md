Waterfall Model 
Study of Existing System

The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases. Easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model. Each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.  It works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.
