        <h1>Trip Overview</h1>
        <p>Trek through the incredible Annapurna region and be awed by the Nepalese Himalayas. These snow-capped peaks, mist-shrouded valleys,
            isolated communities and remote monasteries will inspire those with a bold spirit and a yearning for a definitive nature experience.
            Reach altitudes of more than 5000 metres, discover the ancestral traditions of the local people and immerse yourself completely in the
            spectacular mountain wilderness of the Annapurna Circuit. This is a challenging trip, but the sense of accomplishment will leave even
            the most seasoned trekker with some unforgettable memories
        </p>

        <p> The Annapurna Circuit is one of the most popular treks in Nepal, and rightly so. On this route, the scenery and culture dramatically change
            from subtropical forests, paddy fields, and the world’s deepest river gorge to ice flows, a high mountain pass, arid cliffs, and mountain views.<br></p>

        <p> Passing through Manang, the trek starts with views the Manaslu range, Tibetan-like Buddhist villages, and woodlands, through the Marshyangdi Valley.
            Heading towards the high Thorong La Pass, a host of mountains come into view, including the Annapurna Massif, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and Tilicho Peak.
            The trail continues over the pass to enter Mustang and the Hindu pilgrimage town of Muktinath and on down the Kali Gandaki Valley, past the unique and
            interesting village of Marpha with its small monastery, narrow cobbled streets, and apple orchards, on to the hot springs at Tatopani and the view point of Poon Hill.<br></p>

        <p> From Poon Hill, it is possible to see more than 20 of the highest mountains within the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges
            This trek allows for proper acclimatization before tackling the Thorong La pass at 5,414m. However, it is a long trek, with an average day being 6-7 hours,
            and a good basic physical fitness is recommended.
            With the varied landscapes, villages, and peoples along the trail, and of course, the majestic mountains, it is a photographer’s paradise. It is also a way
            to discover the different aspects, cultures, and landscapes of the country in one trip, and while circling the Annapurna range!<br></p>

        <p>The temple and 108 waterspouts at Muktinath are holy to Hindus and form part of the cultural history of Nepal. Just a short hike down the trail and the villages
            of Jharkot and Kagbeni plunge the visitor back into a Buddhist culture of monasteries and prayer flags.
            Kagbeni is a charming village: from Kagbeni another trail enters Upper Mustang, and there is a constant stream of yak and mule trains taking goods north.
            Exploring the tiny village, there are many interesting sights such as almost prehistoric clay effigies. This trek is certainly varied and full of daily
            surprises and interesting finds and accompanied all the way with up close and personal mountain views!</p>

        </div>
        <p>A few hours’ walk from Lo Manthang is Gyakar, with its famous Gompa. Ghar Gompa is over 1,200 years old, is dedicated to Guru
            Rinpoche, who traveled these areas then.Gompa is famous for its rock paintings and the fact it is believed that if you make a
            wish here, it will come true. So make a wish at the Ghar Gompa, and hope to return again someday!The trek is at a relatively
            high altitude (3,000m to 3,800m), intensified by the dry air.While it is no problem for those born at this altitude to travel
            at speed, visitors will be more leisurely in their hike to avoid any altitude-related problems. On average, walking takes 5 to 7
            hours a day, and some paths are particularly windy and dusty.But this trek into the restricted area of Upper Mustang, which
            in part follows the ancient salt route, will remain in one’s memory forever.
        </p>
        <h1>Why The Annapurna Circuit Trek?</h1>
        <p>Ascend to the clouds and reach an altitude of 5416 metres as you cross the Thorung
            La Pass along the Annapurna Circuit. Testing your mind and body, this is one hell of an accomplishment.Uncover a different side of the Himalayas,
            trekking past terraced rice fields, oak and rhododendron forests, there’s a diverse array of nature that awaits in the Annapurna region.
            <br>
            Learn about life in Nepalese mountain communities, get to know locals and meet other trekkers while you stay in teahouses in the small communities along the way.
            Discover Nepal’s compact capital in Kathmandu. With a limited amount of time spent here to discover its bazaars
            and temples, why not extend your stay beforehand to get a real feel of Nepalese culture.
